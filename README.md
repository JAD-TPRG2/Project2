# Project2

This project uses Python to create a server and client that communicate with each other. The client requests data from a Raspberry Pi using vcgencmd commands and samples them 50 times. The data is displayed on the server and PySimpleGUI is used to display the client and server status, data that is being called and number of iterations the program has gone through. Threading is used to display data in the GUI while requesting and sending the data form client to server.
